# boilerplate

Boilerplate html for very quick one-off single-page sites. Aren't you tired of rummaging for a base template for a site when you just want to knock something out?

Rules: 
 * One folder = one site
 * CSS3 and Flexbox; I don't care about legacy browsers anymore
 * When in doubt, quick & dirty
